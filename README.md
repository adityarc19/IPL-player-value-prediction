#### * Prediction is made on the basis of data of past two IPL seasons (2019 & 2020).
#### * I have used 'Orthogonal Matching Pursuit' as a regression algorithm for this prediction problem. 

#### Orthogonal Matching Pursuit Algorithm:
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit Algorithm (OMP) is a greedy compressed sensing recovery algorithm which selects the best fitting column of the sensing matrix in each iteration. A least squares (LS) optimization is then performed in the subspace spanned by all previously picked columns.

Check out [scikit-learn website](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_omp.html) for more on OMP model usage.
